# Multilingual Code-Switching Thesis

## Overview
This repository contains the research, code, and resources for a Machine Learning thesis project focused on multilingual code-switching analysis and modeling. The project investigates code-switching phenomena in text involving three languages: **English**, **Tagalog**, and **Cebuano**.

## About Code-Switching
Code-switching is a linguistic phenomenon where speakers or writers alternate between two or more languages or language varieties within a single conversation or text. This is particularly common in multilingual communities, especially in the Philippines where English, Tagalog, and Cebuano are frequently mixed in everyday communication.

## Project Objectives
The primary goals of this thesis are to:
- Analyze patterns and characteristics of code-switching in multilingual text (English-Tagalog-Cebuano)
- Develop machine learning models capable of understanding and processing code-switched text
- Contribute to the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource and code-switched languages
- Create datasets and methodologies that can benefit future research in multilingual NLP

## Languages Covered
- **English**: A global lingua franca widely used in the Philippines
- **Tagalog**: The basis of Filipino, the national language of the Philippines
- **Cebuano**: A major Visayan language spoken by approximately 20 million people in the Philippines

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized to support reproducible research and includes:
- **Data**: Datasets and preprocessing scripts (to be added)
- **Models**: Machine learning model implementations and experiments (to be added)
- **Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization tools (to be added)
- **Documentation**: Research notes, methodology descriptions, and findings (to be added)

## Current Status
This project is currently under active development as part of an ongoing thesis research.
